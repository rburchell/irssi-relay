# irssi-relay

irssi-relay is a simple script to provide a representation of irssi's data
structures using the [weechat relay
protocol](https://www.weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_relay_protocol.en.html).

simply put, it allows you to use the same irc connection you know and love from
other user interfaces, like [glowing-bear](https://github.com/glowing-bear/glowing-bear).

# patches

got an itch to scratch? that's great. feel free to submit a pull request! :)

* connect your client

# authors

irssi-relay is the culmination of a tireless amount of effort from (but not
limited to) the following people:

* Thomas Stagner (large amounts of implementation, reverse-engineering)
* Robin Burchell (initial ideas & implementation, reverse-engineering)
* Timothy J Fontaine (irssi_proxy_websocket, the basis for this work)
